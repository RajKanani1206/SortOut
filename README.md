# SortOut

This is a web app built using React and is used to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, etc.

This app can be accessed here: [https://rajkanani1206.github.io/SortOut/](https://rajkanani1206.github.io/SortOut/).
I hope you have fun playing around with it.

## Purpose

I wanted to improve my skills with React and also learn classic sorting algorithms. This project turned out to be a great way to achieve both of the mentioned objectives at the same time.
